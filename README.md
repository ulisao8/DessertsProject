# DessertsProject

The project is made in Swift UI to be shorter in the implementation of the UI.
Use combine and an MVVM architecture that is the best for SwiftUI.
Add some comments to the code but the truth is very practical and simple to read, it has some improvements in performance issue for requests. 
Use Xcode 14.3.
I do not use third-party libraries, it is native code.
